This experiment seeks to evaluate the capacity of a network to understand
generalizations gained through experimentation. Specifically we seek to
determine how a network fairs at generally interpretting massively
overparameterized distributions with only a select collection of examples.

While the ultimate application of this technology is to engage simulations
and real work counterfactual examinations more effectively, here it will
suffice to withhold information from the network as though such data were
undiscovered.

Note: This data can be run within a notebook or else it may also be deployed
